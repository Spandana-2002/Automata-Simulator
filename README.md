# **Automata Simulator**
## **INTRODUCTION**

Welcome to the Automaton repository. This repository contains the code and resources for simulating automata, including finite state machines and pushdown automata.

The goal of this project is to provide a tool for simulating and understand the behavior of different types of automata. This can be useful for educational purposes, as well as for testing and debugging the behavior of automata in various applications. The code is written in Python.

We hope that this implementation will be useful for students, educators, and researchers in the field of automata theory.

The repository is organized as follows:

- **src**: contains the scripts and programs for simulating and visualizing automata.
- **examples**: contains examples of automata and their input for testing the code.


## **GETTING STARTED**


1. Clone the repository

    ``` 
    git clone https://github.com/Senume/Automata-Simulator.git
    ```

2. Create a new automata discription file and save it. (As such in given in the Example directory)
3. To the file, follow command in terminal
    ```
    python3 dir/example_automata.py Inputstring
    ```
